# CS235-DataStructuresProjects
These are some projects from my data structures class. This was the second computer science class I ever took, so these labs are more about implementing concepts than they are about solving problems.
In this class, I implemented a stack, queue, deque, linked list, iterator, set, and hash map. I also implmeneted a binary search tree, quicksort, and a maze solver that uses recursion.
